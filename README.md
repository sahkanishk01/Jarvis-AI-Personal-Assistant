Jarvis AI 🤖

Welcome to Jarvis AI — your personal voice-controlled virtual assistant, inspired by Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S!
This project uses powerful libraries and models to perform tasks like searching information, opening applications, speaking to users, answering queries, and much more — all through voice commands.

🚀 Features
🎙️ Voice Recognition for hands-free commands

🧠 Smart responses to user queries

🌐 Web search and online tasks

📂 Open and manage local applications

🗣️ Text-to-Speech engine for human-like responses

🕑 Time, Weather, and System Status updates

🧹 Customization and easy extensions

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍

SpeechRecognition (voice input)

Pyttsx3 (text-to-speech output)

Webbrowser module (for opening websites)

OS module (for system-level operations)

📸 Demo
Coming soon! (You can upload a small demo video or GIF here to show Jarvis in action)

📦 Installation
Follow these simple steps to set up Jarvis AI locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Jarvis-AI.git

# 2. Navigate to the project folder

# 4. Run the application
python jarvis.py
🧩 Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or above

Libraries: speechrecognition, pyttsx3, wikipedia, webbrowser, os, datetime

You can install them all by:

🧠 How It Works
Speak your command into the microphone.

Jarvis listens, processes the command using speech recognition.

It executes the appropriate task: speaking back, opening apps, searching, or answering.

Continues running in a listening loop for continuous interaction.

✨ Future Enhancements
Integrate GPT models for even smarter conversations

Add GUI for visual controls

Home automation support (IoT integration)

Multi-language support

Voice Authentication security
